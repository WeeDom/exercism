Hi,

A good effort, which does work, but I can't approve it.

What we're looking to achieve, from this exercise, is for you to create a data structure representing the twelve gifts and days. Then, exercise your coding muscles to interrogate that structure to return the correct verse(s).

You can do this in various ways,using dicts, tuples, or anything else to create the required structure.

Give it another go, and I look forward to seeing your next iteration.

Most importanly, have fun!
