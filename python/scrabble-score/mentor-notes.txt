Hi,

A nice try, and a working solution. What the main challenge is, though, isn't calculating the scores. What we want to see is you creating the data structure programmatically.

Try grouping them letters by score (tuples, dicts, list, whatever) and then calculating the score per letter from that. It's much more readable, and much more maintainable.

Thanks
